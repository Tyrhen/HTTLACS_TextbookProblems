# HTTLACS_TextbookProblems
This repository holds solutions I created for the textbook problems in "How To Think Like A Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3"
The goal I would like to achieve by reading and working through this textbook is a solid foundation in programming principles and further my ability to create clean software architecture. Learning fundamental data structures and algorithms is also an objective.
Happy Learning!
